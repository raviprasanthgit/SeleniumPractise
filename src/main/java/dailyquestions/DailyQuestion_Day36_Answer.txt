1.What is the difference bitween final, finally, finalize keywords in java?

Final: is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed.
Final is a keyword

Finally: is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not.
But finally is useful for
    more than just exception handling - it allows the programmer to avoid having cleanup code accidentally bypassed by a return, continue, or break. Putting cleanup code in a finally block is
always a good practice, even when no exceptions are anticipated.
Finally is a block

Finalize: is used to perform clean up processing just before an object is garbage collected.
Finalize is a method.


2.Explain the four different constructors to create a Hashmap with examples?

HashMap(): This constructor constructs a default HashMap.
HashMap<datatype1, datatype2> hm=new HashMap<datatype1, datatype2>();

HashMap(Map m): This constructor initializes the hash map by using the elements of the given Map object m.
Ex:HashMap<datatype1, datatype2> hm=new HashMap<datatype1, datatype2>();
HashMap<datatype1, datatype2> hm1=new HashMap<datatype1, datatype2>(hm);

HashMap(int capacity): 
This constructor initializes the capacity of the hash map to the given integer value, capacity.
Ex: HashMap<datatype1, datatype2> hm=new HashMap<datatype1, datatype2>(capacity);

HashMap(int capacity, float fillRatio):
This constructor initializes both the capacity and fill ratio of the hash map by using its arguments.
ex: HashMap<datatype1, datatype2> hm=new HashMap<datatype1, datatype2>(2,2.5f);
