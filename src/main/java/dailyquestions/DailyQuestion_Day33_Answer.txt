How maven dependencies are downloaded and Stored?
Maven dependencies are downloaded from repo1.maven.org and stored in local repository of the system (example, "C:\Users\TestLeaf\.m2\repository")

Maven local repository is a local folder that is used to store project's dependencies (plugin jars and other files which are downloaded by Maven). 
When we build a Maven project, all dependency files will be stored in your Maven local repository.


Maven Lifecycle

Default lifecycle has the following steps,

-Generate source/generate resources : validate the project and verify all necessary information is available
-Compile : compile the source code of the project
-test : test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
-package : take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
-integration-test :  run the package and with the results of integration tests, quality could be determined.
-install : install the package into the local repository.
-deploy : deploy in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

Goal that we used have used so far...

1) test	Test the application
2) compile	Compile the TestCases and TestSuites
3) test:test-resources	Copy any resources that must be present for run tests

In addition to it, we have plugin goals and report goals...
