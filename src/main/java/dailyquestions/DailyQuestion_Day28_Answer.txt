1. Explain Grid, can a single system act as both Hub and node?

The Selenium Grid is a testing tool which allows us to run our tests on different machines against 
different browsers. It is a part of the Selenium Suite which specialise in running multiple tests 
across different browsers, operating system and machines. 
A grid consists of a single hub, and one or more nodes. Yes, a single system can act as both Hub and node.
Hub is referred to a Server and Node, which can be multiple systems used for testing through the Grid network.

The Selenium Hub(server) acts as the controller that receives the requests to execute tests on certain 
platforms and browsers then redirects them to the appropriate Node that matches the request.  

2. How do you change your Web driver to run in remote machines?

Answer: We first create an object for the RemoteWebDriver class. In the constructor of the RemoteWebDriver class we pass the IP address of the remote machine in which
	tests need to be run.
	
EX:	Syntax: RemoteWebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://192.168.43.139:4444/wd/hub"), dc);
