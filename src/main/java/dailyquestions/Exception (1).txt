Patterns to solve theoretical problems:

- *3P Answers*
- *Technical* | *Selenium* | *Project*

For example, to explain concept in the interview - use these hints:

*Technical:*

- error that may occur
- Types: Checked (Compile time) and Runtime 
- Checked can be handled using try-catch or throws
- Runtime only by try-catch

*Selenium:*

Some examples here:

- All selenium exceptions are Runtime
- Ex: NoSuchElementException, UnHandledAlertException

*Project:*

In our customized selenium automation framework, we implemented exceptions (with try-catch-finally) in all Selenium library methods.
